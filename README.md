# zcash-devtool

This repository contains a CLI app for working with Zcash transactions and the
Zcash blockchain, including stateless Zcash wallet functionality based upon the
`zcash_client_backend` and `zcash_client_sqlite` crates. It is built by
developers, for developers for use in prototyping Zcash functionality, and
should not be considered production-ready. The command-line API that this tool
exposes can and will change at any time and without warning.

## Security Warnings

**DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!!!**

This app has not been written with security in mind. It does however have affordances
such as encryption of the mnemonic seed phrases that should make it viable for small
scale experimentation, at your own risk.

## Usage

No binary artifacts are provided for this crate; it is generally used via
`cargo run` as follows:

To obtain the help docs:
```
cargo run --release -- --help
```
To obtain the help for a specific command (in this case, `init`)
```
cargo run --release -- --help init
```

To create a new empty testnet wallet:
```
cargo run --release -- -w <wallet_dir> init
cargo run --release -- -w <wallet_dir> sync
```

See the help docs for `init` for additional information, including for how to
initialize a mainnet wallet. Initializing a mainnet wallet will require
specifying a mainnet lightwallet server, e.g.
```
cargo run --release -- -w <wallet_dir> init -n "main" -s "zecrocks"
cargo run --release -- -w <wallet_dir> sync -s "zecrocks"
```

Whenever you update the `zcash_client_sqlite` dependency, in order to run
necessary migrations:
```
cargo run --release -- -w <wallet_dir> upgrade
```

If you want to run with debug or trace logging:
```
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- -w <wallet_dir> <command>
```
